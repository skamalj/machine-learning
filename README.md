## Implementation
Excercises in this repository are direct implementation of Coursera course - Machine learning by Andrew Ng. 
Actual course implementation is in Octave, I have tried this implemetation in Systemml on Spark running on Yarn.

## Pre-requisites
* HDFS and Yarn - [Refer here of Install](https://my-bigdata-blog.blogspot.in/search/label/HADOOP)
* Spark         - [Refer here of Install](https://my-bigdata-blog.blogspot.in/search/label/Spark)
* IPython - I used Jupyter with Anaconda
